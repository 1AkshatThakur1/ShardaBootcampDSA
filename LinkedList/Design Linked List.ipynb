Your LinkedList should support the following functionalities:\n","1. Adding a node at the end of the list.\n","2. Adding a node at the beginning of the list.\n","3. Creating a node with a given value.\n","4. Adding a node at a specific index.\n","5. Retrieving the value of a node at a specific index.\n","\n","Implement the required methods to achieve the functionalities described above.\n","\n","Input Format:\n","The input consists of a series of commands, each represented by a number followed by arguments if applicable. The commands are as follows:\n","1. `1 value`: Add a node at the end of the list with the given value.\n","2. `2 value`: Add a node at the beginning of the list with the given value.\n","3. `3 index value`: Add a node at the specified index with the given value.\n","4. `4 index`: Retrieve the value at the specified index.\n","5. `5`: Exit the program.\n","\n","Output Format:\n","\n","For each retrieval command (`4`), output the value of the node at the specified index. For all other commands, no output is required.\n","\n","\n","Constraints:\n","Values stored in the linked list are integers.\n","Indexing is 0-based.\n","The maximum number of elements in the linked list is constrained by available memory.\n","[Refer Sample Input and Output.]\n","\n","[All text in bold corresponds to input and the rest corresponds to output]\n","\n","Sample Input and Output :\n","\n","Linked List Operations:\n","1.
