Each node harbors a burning curiosity about the next node in the list, specifically desiring knowledge of the next node with a greater integer value. Your mission is to craft a program that, when given this linked list as input, produces an array. This array should encapsulate the next greater integer value for each node in the list. If a node has no next greater integer value, the corresponding array element should be gracefully set to 0.\n","\n","Define a structure\n","\n","ListNode {\n","            int val;\n","            ListNode next;\n","}                     \n","\n","Include functions:\n","\n","int[] nextLargerNodes(ListNode head) --- This method computes and returns an array where each element represents the next greater node value for the corresponding node in the provided linked list.
